# Graph

## Basic Definitions:

A graph **G** is an ordered pair of a set **V** of vertices and a set **E** of edges.

- G  = (V, E)
- **Ordered pair:** (a,b) != (b,a) if a != b; order matters
- **Unordered pair:** {a,b}; set of two elements and order does not matter
- **Vertex:** Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex.
- **Edge:** Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices.
  - **Undirected:** Connection is two way; (u,v) = (v,u)
  - **Directed:** Connection is one way: (u,v) != (v,u)



**Degree of a vertex:**

- Undirected = number of neighbors to a vertex
- Directed:
  - **In-degree:** number of edges coming to a vertex
  - **Out-degree:** number of edges coming out of a vertex



Complete Graphs:

* Undirected: 
* **Directed:** A complete directed graph (digraph) is a type of directed graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a pair of unique edges which are going in opposite directions.
