# Languages and Grammars

**Formal Language:** A language that is specified by a well-defined set of rules of syntax

**Formal Grammar:** 

* A formal grammar G is any compact, precise definition of a language L. 
* A grammar implies an algorithm that would generate all legal sentences of the language.

## Phase-structure Grammars

**Vocabulary**: A vocabulary (or alphabet) **V** is a finite, nonempty set of elements called symbols.

**Word**: A word (or sentence) over V is a string of finite length elements of V .

**Empty String  λ:** The empty string or null string, denoted by λ, is the string **containing no symbols**.

S**et of Words & Set of Language:** 

* The set of all words over V is denoted by V^∗^ . 
* A language over V is a subset of V^∗^ .

**Phrase-Structure Grammar:**

* A phrase-structure grammar **G = (V,T,S,P)** consists of:
  * a vocabulary **V** 
  * a subset **T** of V consisting of **terminal symbols**
  * a **start symbol S from V**
  * a finite set of **productions P**.
*  The set V − T is denoted by N.
* Elements of N are called nonterminal symbols.
* Every production in P must contain at least one nonterminal on its left side.

**Language Generated by G/Language of G/L(G):**

* The set of all strings of terminals that are derivable from the starting state S
* $L(G) = \{w\in T^* |S^* \Rightarrow w\}$



### General Example 

**ex.** Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,1,A,B,S}, T = {0,1}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 0A,S → 1A,A → 0B,B → 1A,B → 1.

​	1. Show that 10101 belongs to the language generated by G.

​		S → 1A = 1A

​		A → 0B = 10B

​		B → 1A = 101A

​		A → 0B = 1010B

​		B → 1 = **10101**

​	2. Show that 10110 does not belong to the language generated by G.

​		S → 1A = 1A

​		A → 0B = 10B

​		B → 1A = 101A

​		P does not contain any rules that allow two 1s to be adjacent to each other.

​	3. What is the language generated by G?

​		Since  S → 0A and S → 1A we know that strings must start with either 0 or 1

​		Using production rules we know that we will next get 101A or 001A and that the string terminates 		with only B → 1.

​		$\therefore \{0(01)^n|n\geq1\}\cup\{1(01)^n|n\geq1\}$

### Finding a phrase-structure grammar

**ex.** Find a phrase-structure grammar for each of these languages.

1. The set consisting of the bit strings 0, 1, and 11

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,1,S}, T = {0,1}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 0, S → 1, S → 11.

2.  The set of bit strings containing only 1s

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {1,S,A}, T = {1}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 1A, A → 1A, A → λ.

3.  The set of bit strings that start with 0 and end with 1

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,1,S,A}, T = {0,1}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 0A1, A → 0A, A → 1A, A → λ.

4. The set of bit strings that consist of a 0 followed by an even number of 1s

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,1,S,A}, T = {0,1}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 0A, A → 11A, A → λ.

### Constructing a phrase-structure grammar to generate a set

Construct phrase-structure grammars to generate each of these sets.

1. $\{0^n|n\geq0\}$

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,S}, T = {0}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 0S, S → λ

2. $\{1^n0|n\geq0\}$

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,1,S,A}, T = {0,1}, and set of productions P consisting of S → A0, A → A1, A → λ

3. $\{(000)^n|n\geq0\}$

   Let G = (V,T,S,P) be the phrase-structure grammar with V = {0,S}, T = {0}, and set of productions P consisting of S → 000S, S → λ.

* **Root**: Starting symbol
  * **Internal Vertices**: Nonterminal symbols
    * **Leaves**: Terminal symbols

## Backus-Naur Form

* Instead of listing all the productions separately, we can combine all those with the same nonterminal symbol on the left-hand side into one statement.
* Instead of using the symbol →in a production, we use the symbol ::=
* We enclose all nonterminal symbols in brackets, $\langle \rangle$, and we list all the right-hand sides of productions in the same statement, separating them by bars, |.

### Give production rules in Backus-Naur form

Give production rules in Backus-Naur form for an identifier if it can consist of

1.  one to four uppercase or lowercase letters beginning with an uppercase letter.

   $\langle identifier\rangle ::== \langle ucletter\rangle|\langle ucletter\rangle\langle letter\rangle|\langle ucletter\rangle\langle letter\rangle\langle letter\rangle|\langle ucletter\rangle\langle letter\rangle\langle letter\rangle\langle letter\rangle$

   $\langle letter\rangle ::== \langle ucletter\rangle|\langle lcletter\rangle$

   $\langle ucletter\rangle ::== A|B|C...|Z$

   $\langle lcletter\rangle ::== a|b|c...|z$

2.  a lowercase letter, followed by a digit or an underscore, followed by three or four alphanumeric characters (lower or uppercase letters and digits).

   $\langle identifier\rangle ::== \langle lcletter\rangle\langle digitorus\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle|$

   $\langle lcletter\rangle\langle digitorus\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle\langle alphanumeric\rangle$

   

   $\langle digitorus\rangle ::== \langle digit\rangle| \_$

   $\langle alphanumeric\rangle ::== \langle letter\rangle|\langle digit\rangle$

   $\langle letter\rangle ::== \langle ucletter\rangle|\langle lcletter\rangle$

   $\langle ucletter\rangle ::== A|B|C...|Z$

   $\langle lcletter\rangle ::== a|b|c...|z$

   $\langle ucletter\rangle ::== A|B|C...|Z$

   $\langle digit\rangle ::== 0|1|2...|9$
