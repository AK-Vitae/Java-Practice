# Set Operations

**Union of Sets**

* Let A and B be sets. The union of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set that contains those elements **that are either in A or in B, or in both.**
* A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B}

**Intersection of Sets**

* Let A and B be sets. The intersection of the sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set containing those elements **in both A and B.**
* A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B}
