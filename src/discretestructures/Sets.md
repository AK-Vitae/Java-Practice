# Sets

* **Set**: unordered collection of objects
* **Elements**: An object in the set
* a **∈** A to denote that a is an element of the set A.
*  a **̸∈** A denotes that a is not an element of the set A

## Important Sets

| Number Set | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **N**      | {0,1,2,3,...}, the set of **natural numbers**                |
| **Z**      | {...,−2,−1,0,1,2,...}, the set of **integers**               |
| **Z^+^**   | {1,2,3,...}, the set of **positive integers**                |
| **Q**      | {p/q \| p ∈ **Z**, q ∈ **Z**, and q != 0}, the set of **rational numbers** |
| **R**      | the set of **real numbers**                                  |
| **R^+^**   | the set of **positive real numbers**                         |

## Set Notation

**Roster Notation**: Used with discrete sets (countable)

* S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
* Not roster notation: 0 <= x <= 1

**Set-Builder Notation**: Can be used for any type of set

* S = {x | x ∈ N, 1 <= x <= 5}
* | = "such that"

**Interval Notation**: Used with continuous sets

* B = {x |0 <= x <= 1} = **[0, 1]**

**Universal Set**: The set of all elements under consideration

**Empty Set**: { } or ∅



## Set Relationships

* Sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements
* ∀x(x ∈ A ↔ x ∈ B, A = B if A and B are equal sets
