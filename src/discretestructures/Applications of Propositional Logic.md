## Translating Propositions

**ex.**  

q: You can ride the rollercoaster

r: You are under 4 feet tall

s: You are older than 16 years old

Translate: (r ∪ ¬s) ⇒ ¬q

Might be helpful to write shell: if r or not s, then not q

**If** <u>you are under 4 feet tall</u> **or** <u>**not** older than 16 years old</u> **then** <u>you can **not** ride the rollercoaster</u>
