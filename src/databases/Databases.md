# Databases

## Introduction

Data -> Facts: Product of observation

Ways to register data:

* Unstructured Data: ex. txt files
* Structured Data (SQL) : ex. tabular representation
* Semi-structured (MongoDB): ex. XML, JSON

Why keep data?

* To take some action based on the data
* Data that is used to answer questions do analysis ->information

### Source of Data

Mini World:

* Data cannot be known about the entire world or about everything or every topic.
* We need to restrict the domain from which we are going to gather data.

* The data that we store about our mini-world can be:
  * Used directly
  * Through a system (Information System)

Information System (Application) Design

* **Left Track is system design** while **right track is data design**

	G-->H[PHYSICAL DESIGN]

```



### Data Storage

* **Sequential (access) files**: 
  * Data can only be read/stored sequentially.
* **Random access files:** 
  * In order to be able to effectively use random access files, we need to have efficient algorithms for insertion, deletion, and searching.
  * B+ trees, Hash Tables

### Concurrency

* Two or more users want to access the same file location at the same time

### DBMS (Database Management System)

* **Definition**: efficient, reliable, convenient, and safe multi-user storage of and access to massive amounts of persistent data

#### Desirable services provide by many IM  (Information Management System) and DBMS

* **Persistence**: Maintain information even after program stops
* **Convenient Access**: 
  * Ability to ask question declaratively rather than programmatically
  * Hide and change implementation
  * Queries optimized to speed up answering
* **Deal with massive amounts of facts**
* **Performance**: High speed even in the presence of many operations and data
* **Consistency during concurrent access**.

#### Other Features (Specialized IM)

* **Resilience**: Ability to survive hardware, software, and power failures
* **Reliability**: Almost always up
* **Scalability**: Data can be scaled to demand or size needs

### Types of Database Models

* **Hierarchical Model**
  * Assumes that all the data that is **stored is organized hierarchically**
  * The Hierarchical model looks like a **tree**, and elements are found by following the links.
  * Every node has just one parent
  * ex. File Systems and Geographical Information Systems
* **Network Model**
  * Assumes that a **given node might have more than one parent**
  * Search by following pointers
* **Relational Model**
  * Uses relations or tables
  * Search by content not by following links or pointers.
  * ER Diagram -> Relations
* **Object Oriented Model**
  * Lots of problems when communicating OO applications with databases in relational model
  * In order to try to circumvent the problems of OO â€“ Database connectivity and work on a common set of data.

## Conceptual Design

### Entity - Relationship Diagrams

* **Entity Sets**: Set of similar elements
  * No duplicate elements
  * **Candidate Key:** minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies an element 
    * **Minimal**: If an attribute is removed from a set then there is not enough information to uniquely identify the element.
    * ex. name alone can't identify an employee but name and phone number might
  * **Primary Key:**
    * The chosen candidate key will be enforced by the DBMS
    * The primary key attributes will be **underlined in their circles**
    * Every entity set must have a primary key
  * Rectangle with element
* **Attributes**: Aspects of an elements
  * **Circles** = **Single Attribute** (ex. Name)
  * **Double Border Circles** = **Multivalued Attributes** (ex. Phone Numbers)
  * **Circles with child circles** = **Composite Attributes** (ex. Address)
  * **Dotted Circle** = **Derived Attribute**: computed from the other attributes in the entity set (ex. age calculated form date of birth attribute)
* **Domain**: Need to specify if attributes aren't clear
* **Relationship**: Connection between Entity Sets
  * Represented by a **diamond**
  * Attributes can be added to the relationship
* **Cardinality**:
  * Many to Many
  * One to Many: Every element from A is related to at most one element from B (-> at most one)
    * ex. Professor can teach many courses, but a course is taught by 1 professor
  * One to One: Each element from A is related to at most one element from B and each element from B is related to at most one element from A
    * ex. A Professor can only have one office, and a office can only have one professor

ex. Employees work for Departments

* Departments have an id, address, name, phone
* Employees have a ssn, name, phone, dob
* Each employee cannot work for more than one department
* Each department can have many employees

![](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Employee-Departments ER Diagram .png)

* **Participation Constraints:**
  * **Total**: Every Element from one side must participate in the relation ship 
    * Represented by a **thick line = at least one**
    * A total one to many relationship = at least one element and at most one element = **exactly one = thick line with arrow**
  * **Partial**: **Normal Line**
* **Assumptions**: Include in diagram to help determine decisions.
* **Cardinality Notation**:
  * min / at least . . max / at most
    * Partial Participation Constraint (**Normal Line**)  = 0 . . N
    * Total Participation Constraint (**Thick Line**) = 1 . . N
    * Partial Participation Constraint with Arrow (**Normal Line with Arrow**) = 0 . . 1
    * Total Participation Constraint with Arrow (**Thick Line with Arrow**) = 1 . . 1
  * Put on a Normal Line to relationship
  * Always use arrow notation unless it is necessary  to use cardinality notation

* **Roles**: Used when an Element uses a relationship to itself
  * Place roles on respective lines

### ISA Hierarchy

* Inheritance
* Used to factor out common attributes
* Used to divide in sets (subsets)
* **Triangle with "ISA" in it**
* ISA property (test): Child element "is a" subset of the Parent element
* **Constraints**:
  * Written next to ISA triangle as **{Covering Constraint Type, Overlap Constraint Type}**
  * **Covering**: Will sets cover all possible elements?
    * Complete: Yes
    * Partial: No
  * **Overlap:** Do sets overlap?
    * Disjoint: No
    * Overlapping: Yes

ex. Cardinality Notation for the following description:

A veterinary hospital only treats dogs and cats (use ISA). Clients have an address, phone number and client ID. Each pet has a name, a pet ID and belongs to exactly one client. Each client can have at most 5 cats and 2 dogs. 

![](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Pet(Cat&Dog)-Client ER Diagram.jpg)



### Weak Entity Sets

* Entity set that **does not have its own keys (primary keys)**
* Will take the keys from another Entity Set
* Will be a **double border rectangle**
* Identifying relationship = **double border diamond**
* Weak entity set has a **Total Participation Constraint with an Arrow** (<==)
* Weak entity sets can help contribute to a primary key with a **partial key = dashed underline**

ex. E-R Diagram for the following:

* Book

  * authors
  * title
  * date

* BookEdition

  * publisher
  * format
  * date
  * Note: There is no primary key here

* BookCopy (needs to inherit attributes from book)

  * callNumber
  * location
  * copyNumber

* **Note: Subclasses does not automatically make some thing comply with IsA inheritance.** 

* Need to use the IsA test

  ![](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Book-BookEdition-BookCopy ER Diagram.jpg)

* Concept shown is called **Manifestation**

  * BookEdition is a manifestation of a book
  * BookCopy is a manifestation of a BookEdition



ex. We want to keep track of expenses of Employees on their dependent's health insurance policies

* Weak Entity to Entity

![](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\WeakEntity-Entity ER Diagram.jpg)

### Design Considerations

* Entity set vs Attribute
  * Multivalued attributes may cause problems with redundancy
  * Better to just use them as another entity set
  * E-R diagram not unique for every situation
* Attribute vs Relationship
  * Using an attribute or having an entity have a relationship with itself

### N-ary Relationships

* Some relationships are ill conceived and can be better represented in a binary relationship
* N-ary relationp -> Binary Relationship:
  * Change central relationship into a weak entity set
  * Have the weak entity set connected exactly one to each entity set (Identifying Relationship)
  * Process called **Reification**

ex. Convert a Part, Project, and Maker relationship into a binary relationship

1. Add a couple of attributes to each entity set
2. Use Reification to transform it into a diagram with only binary relationships

![](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Part-Project-Maker Diagram.jpg)

### Aggregation

* Trying to connect a relationship to another relationship
* Draw a dotted line around the central relationship to have it treated as one entity.
* Then use reification to achieve the proper diagram

## Relational Model

* Everything is a relation
* Relations = Tables
  * First Row: **Header (Schema)**
  * Column Names = **Fields**
  * Each Row = **Tuples**
  * Content below header = **Instance; is dynamic**

ex. Student Table/Relation

|  id  | name  | age  |
| :--: | :---: | :--: |
| 5275 | Smith |  18  |
| 2653 | Guldu |  22  |
| 5463 | Jones |  18  |

Schema: Student(id: integer, name: varchar(50), age: integer)

* Domains:
  * int/integer
  * double/float
  * varchar(n) = string of length at most n
  * char(n) = string of length exactly equal to n
  * date
  * time
  * datetime
  * boolean

ex. Write the relation database schema for a Company that has employees who have a SSN, name, phone, date  of birth and work for departments (remember that you need a table for worksFor). Departments have a name, a phone, and a location



### Properties of Relations

* **Degree/r-aty of relation** = number of fields
* **Number of tuples** = cardinality
* **Instances of Relations are sets**
  * No duplicates are allowed
  * Note: Some DBMS will allows some duplicates

* Relational Database
  * Collection of relations with distinct names

### Integrity Constraints (IC)

* DBMS enforces them
* Domain Constraint: Prevent entry of incorrect data
* Might make changes to enforce IC

#### Primary Key (PK)

* Are unique

* **Candidate Key:**  A minimal set of fields that uniquely identifies a tuple
  * A primary key is a chosen candidate key that is enforced by the DBMS
* Primaries keys are stored in B+Trees
* Notations:
  * **PK has several attributes**: Students(sid: int, dob: date, name: varchar(50), primary key (sid))
  * **PK with only one field**: Students(sid: int primary key, dob: date, name: varchar(50))
  * **Informal/Only for examples:** Students(<u>sid</u>, dob, name) - Underlined is the PK

#### Foreign Key (FK)

* Set of fields that makes a reference to a PK of another table

* Example:

  Students(<u>sid</u>, name, age, gpa)

  EnrolledIn(<u>sid</u>, cid, grade, foreign key (sid) references Students)

**Properties:**

1. **Same or compatible domains**

   A(f1, f2, f3, f4, primary key(f2, f3))

   B(g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, primary key(g1, g3), foreign key(g3, g4) references A)

   g3 and g4 actually reference f2 and f3 respectively. **Domain is same or compatible**

2. **FK making a reference to the same table**

   person(ssn, name, parent, primary key(ssn), foreign key(parent) references person)

   parent in this case is a ssn of another person

#### Referential Integrity Constraints

* **Insertion operation:** Inserting a tuple into table
  * DBMS will Reject/**Restrict** as tuple does not exist in referenced table
* **Deletion operation:** Deleting from a table (source table)
  * DBMS will Reject/**Restrict** as tuple in referencing table will reference nothing
  * **Cascade**: DBMS will also delete the tuple that includes the reference from referencing table
  * **set NULL**: Replace the reference with NULL or null value
  * **set default**
* **Update operation**: Updating source table
  * Restrict/Reject
  * Cascade the change
  * set NULL
  * set default
* Operations will be specified in the schema (default action is restrict)
  * on delete _
  * on update _
  * on insert _

### Merge Rule

**IF**: 

â€‹	T(K, X, primary key(K))

â€‹	S(K2, Y, primary key(K2), foreign key (K2) references T)

â€‹	and **Y is not NULL** (because otherwise we don't know what tables an element belongs to)

**THEN**:

â€‹	**Merge**: TS(K, X, Y, primary key(K))

**Merge Priority**: Thick Arrow Side > Arrow Side > Normal Line

* If there is both thick arrows or both normal arrows then merge either side

* If there is a **thick arrow** need to add **NOT NULL to the foreign key**

#### One-to-One

![Merge Rule - One to One](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Merge Rule - One to One.jpg)

```
Office(building, number, sqFT,
	primary key(building, number))
Employee(eid, name, dob, building, number,
	primary key(eid),
	foreign key(building, number) references Office NOT NULL)
```

#### One-to-Many

![Merge Rule - One to Many](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Merge Rule - One to Many.jpg)

```
A(Ka, c, primary key(Ka))
B(Kb, d, primary key(kb)) - Part of the final schema
R(Ka, Kb, p, q, 
	primary key(Ka), 
	foreign key(Ka) references A,
	foreign key(Kb) references B)
Merged: AR(Ka, c, Kb, p, q, 
	primary key(Ka),
	foreign key(Kb) references B) - Part of the final schema
```

#### ISA

![Merge Rule - ISA](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\Merge Rule - ISA.jpg)

```
A(Ka, p, primary key(Ka))
B(Ka, q, primary key(Ka), foreign key(Ka) references A)
C(Ka, s, primary key(Ka), foreign key(Ka) references A)

Merge AB: AB(Ka, p, q, primary key(Ka))
Merge ABC: ABC(Ka, p, q, s, primary key(Ka))
```

Problems:

* Can have many NULL Values
* Not sure how to distinguish which fields are for the child sets 

#### ISA - Collapse Down

![ISA - Collapse Down](C:\Users\akshi\Documents\Computer Science\Java Practice\src\databases\Pictures for Notes\ISA - Collapse Down.jpg)

```
Dog(pid, name, primary key(pid))
Cat(pid, name, primary key(pid))
```

* **Not a merge rule**
* When ISA relationship is {disjoint, complete}

## Relational Design Principles

* Reduce the number of tables
* Avoid unnecessary redundancy
* Reduce NULL values (memory use)

## SQL and MySQL

### General Information

* SQL (structured query language) language **combines four languages** into one:
  * **Create Data Schema** for DBMS
    * Language to provide the schema (L<sub>SCHEMA</sub>)
  * **Tell facts** about the data 
    * Language to tell facts (L<sub>TELL</sub>)
  * **Ask** (query) the DBMS
    * Language to ask questions or query language (L<sub>QUERY</sub>)
  * **Answer**
    * Language in which the answer is provided (L<sub>ANSWER</sub>)

* **Multiple Implementations** 
  * MySQL
  * SQL server
  * Oracle
  * PostgreSQL
  * Compatibility issues between the different implementations of SQL

### How to communicate with SQL

* Command line which requires a semicolon ;
* Application ----------- connection(using JDBC for this class) ----instructions(strings)--->DBMS
  * No semicolon required

### Basic Database Commands

* Create Database: 

  * ```sql
    create database DATABASENAME;
    ```

* Use Database: 

  * ```sql
    use DATABASENAME;
    ```

* Delete Database if exist: 

  * ```sql
    drop database if exists DATABASENAME;
    ```

* Delete (drop) Database: 

  * ```sql
    drop database DATABASENAME;
    ```

* Show all databases

  * ```sql
    show databases;
    ```

### Table (Relation) Commands

Tables referenced in examples:

| Students | Enrolledin | Courses |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| sid      | sid        | cid     |
| name     | cid        | name    |
| age      | grade      | dept    |
| gpa      |            |         |

* **create table**:

  * General Case:

    * ```sql
      create table TABLENAME(
      	field1 type,
          field2 type,
          ...,
          primary key(fields),
          foreign key (fields) references TABLENAME2(PRIMARY KEYS of TABLENAME2)
      );
      ```

  * **One attribute** primary key:

    * ```sql
      create table TABLENAME(
      	field1 type primary key,
          ...,
          field2 type,
          foreign key (fields) references TABLENAME2(PRIMARY KEYS of TABLENAME2)
      );
      ```

* **alter table**:

  * **Drop** field:

    * ```sql
      alter table TABLENAME drop FIELD;
      ```

  * **Add** field:

    * ```sql
      alter table TABLENAME add FIELD type;
      ```

  * **Change** the primary keys or foreign keys of an already created table

    * ```sql
      alter table TABLENAME
      add constraint primary key(field(s));
      ```

    * ```sql
      alter table TABLENAME
      add constraint foreign key(field(s)) 
      	references TABLENAME2(PRIMARY KEYS of TABLENAME2);
      ```

* How to **list** all the tables

  * ```sql
    show tables;
    ```

* **See table's schema**

  * ```sql
    describe TABLENAME;
    ```

* **Delete (drop) table if exists**

  * ```sql
    drop table if exists TABLENAME;
    ```

* **Delete (drop) table**

  * ```sql
    drop table TABLENAME;
    ```

* **Insert** data into table

  * When you only have **some values** for the **tuple**:

    * ```sql
      insert into TABLENAME(fields you want to insert into) values (values);
      ```

  * When you have **all** the **values** for the **tuple:**

    * ```sql
      insert into TABLENAME values 
      	(_, _, _),
      	(_, _, _),
      	(_, _, _);
      ```

    * Order of the tuple is the order of the fields in the relation

* **Delete certain data** from **table:**

  * ```sql
    delete from TABLENAME where CONDITION;
    ```

* **Update values** in the **tables:** 

  * ```sql
    update TABLENAME, TABLENAME2, ...
    	set field1 = _, field2 = _,...
    	where CONDITION;
    ```

* **Alias**

  * Used to rename a certain table/fields used in a query

  * Syntax:

    * ```sql
      tableName/fieldName as ALIASNAME
      tableName/fieldName ALIASNAME
      ```

### Queries

* ```sql
  select field1, field2, ...
  from TABLENAME1, TABLENAME2, ...
  where CONDITION
  ```

* Returns at table where fields names are column names

#### Operators

* **Star or * operator**

  * represents everything

  * ```sql
    select * from TABLENAME1 where CONDITION
    ```

* **Like operator**

  * Used for string comparison (can use regex to match the string)

  * ```sql
    --Students where name starts w/H (0 or more characters after):
    select name from students where name like 'H%';
    --Students where name starts w/H (0 or more characters after):
    select name from students where name like 'H%O';
    --Students where name starts w/H then 4 characters:
    select name from students where name like 'H___';
    ```

* **General Operators**

  * For strings these operators will work in lexicographical order (ex. a > b returns true)
  * **=, >, <, >=, <=, <>(not equal)**
  * **in**
    * Returns true if the value is inside the subquery
  * **not in**
    * Returns true if the value is not inside the subquery
  * **exists**
    * returns true if the subquery is not empty
  * **and**
  * **or**
  * **not**

* **Joining Tables**

  * Gives the cartesian product (cross product) of the tables if no CONDITION is specified
  * If condition is specified, the query will give you a table that contains tuples where that condition is true

* **Set Operators**

  * Returns a set (no duplicates)

  * Attributes (fields) from the first query must match the attributes (fields) of the second query

  * Union:

    * ```sql
      --Names of Students who have enrolled in cs or math courses
      select s.name
      	from students S, 
      	enrolledin e, 
      	courses c
      where s.sid = e.sid 
      	and e.cid = c.cid
      	and c.dept = 'cs'
      	
      union
      
      select s.name
      	from students S, 
      	enrolledin e, 
      	courses c
      where s.sid = e.sid 
      	and e.cid = c.cid
      	and c.dept = 'math';
      ```

  * Intersect:

    * Not supported in MySQL

    * Solution: Subqueries

      * ```sql
        --Names of Students who have enrolled in cs and math courses:
        select s.name

        	enrolledin e, 
        	courses c
        where s.sid = e.sid 
        	and e.cid = c.cid
        	and c.dept = 'cs'
        	and s.sid in(
            	select s.id
        			from students s, 
        			enrolledin e, 
        			courses c
        		where s.sid = e.sid 
        			and e.cid = c.cid
        			and c.dept = 'math'
        		)
        ;
        ```

  * Except:

    * Not supported in MySQL

    * Solution: Subqueries

      * ```sql
        --Students enrolled in 198:336 but not taking 198:323 (using except)
        select s.name
        	from Student s,
        	enrolledin e
        where s.sid = e.sid
        	and e.cid = '198:336'
        
        except

        			and e.cid = '198:323'
        		)
        ;
        ```

* **Subqueries:**

  * X =
  * X in
  * X not in
  * X > any (subquery) 
    * **Returns true** if **x** is **greater** than **at least one element** in the **subquery** 
  * X > all (subquery)
    * **Returns true** if **x** is **greater** than **all elements** in the **subquery**
  * exists (subquery)
    * **Returns true** if the **subquery** is **not empty** 
  * not exists (subquery)

      from students s
      where name = "Horatio"
  );
  ```

* **Distinct**

  * Gets **rid of duplicates**

  * Affects the entire tuple (gives you query that all the fields are unique)

  * ```sql
    --Names of students enrolled in CS courses. No duplicates
    select distinct s.name
    from students s,
    	enrolledin e,
    	courses c
    where s.sid = e.sid
    	and e.cid = c.cid
    	and c.dept = "cs";
    ```
